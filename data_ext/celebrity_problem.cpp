/*
In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. Find the stranger (celebrity) in the minimum number of questions.
We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem. 

Examples:  

Input:
MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 0, 0, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0} }
Output:id = 2
Explanation: The person with ID 2 does not 
know anyone but everyone knows him

Input:
MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0},
           {0, 1, 0, 0},
           {0, 0, 1, 0} }
Output: No celebrity
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
